//Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 
//'Area' having two functions. First function named as 'setDim' takes the length and 
//breadth of the rectangle as parameters and the second function named as 'getArea' returns
//the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth 
//of the rectangle are entered through keyboard.
